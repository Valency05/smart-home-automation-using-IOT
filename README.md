This IoT-based smart home automation system enhances convenience, security, and energy efficiency. It integrates devices for automated lighting, smart locks, voice control, and climate management. Users can remotely monitor and control their homes via smartphones, transforming spaces into intelligent, responsive environments.

In this project there are 4 main functionalities:
  * Automated control of fan using DHT11 sensor
  * Automation of door open and close using servo motor and Ultrasonic sensor
  * Fire and smoke detection using sensors
  * controlling of light and fan virtually using smartphone
